## Deployment

### 1. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
vercel --prod
```

You should have a URL deployed to a domain similar to: `https://your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app/`

### 2. Update environment variables

Add your production URL to your local `.env` file:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME="Your App Name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=<Replace-WITH-YOUR-CDP-API-KEY>
NEXT_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-vercel-project-name.vercel.app/
```

### 3. Upload environment variables to Vercel

Add environment variables to your production environment:

```bash
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_NAME production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY production
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_URL production
```

## Account Association

### 1. Sign Your Manifest

1. Navigate to [Farcaster Manifest tool](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest)

        "payload": "your-payload-here",
        "signature": "your-signature-here"
    },
    frame: {
        // ... rest of your frame configuration
    },
}
```

### 3. Deploy Updates

```

## Testing and Publishing

### 1. Preview Your App

Go to [base.dev/preview](https://base.dev/preview) to validate your app:

2. Use the "Account association" tab to verify the association credentials were created correctly
